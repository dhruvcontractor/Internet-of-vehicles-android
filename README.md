MusicShared Player: Internet of vehicle based music information sharing

Music is the greatest communication in the world. 

Sharing music in different forms has been part of our everyday life whether it is shared by Bluetooth, Internet, Infrared or NFC (Near Field Communication).

Pervasive Computing has played and will continue to play a tremendous role in the emergence and evolution of smart environments which includes homes, offices and vehicles by allowing them to communicate information. 

As far as internet connectivity, we are living in a 4G environment with unlimited internet connectivity starting from mobile phones to personal computers which makes it so much easier for people to be part of a smart environment.

This project however presents how we can overcome the boredom of long and heavy traffic which arises in cities and highways by making the next form of social interaction. This project demonstrates a practical application of IoV (Internet of Vehicles). 

The true beauty of the music is that it connects people from different background without any barriers. Music has been used by most drivers while taking long trips or stuck in a long dense traffic, but it never been used as communication or social networking medium between drivers stuck in traffic and within proximity to each other. 

The idea behind creating a communication medium between you and other drivers is to give them access to the infotainment system in your vehicle, enabling them to get the information on what other drivers are listening to within their proximity and display it in the form of texts and other multimedia. 

This will be achieved by using Bluetooth devices capable to displaying up to 256 characters, which will include information such as artist name, song title, album title, and possibly awards held by the song if they are available.

It will also associate music identification option to fetch information about the song and artist name from the currently playing song either on Pandora, Spotify, YouTube or CD player and broadcast the song information to the other users within their vicinity.  

The proposed system will heavily depend on pulling information from audio fingerprinting database of ACRCloud. This project demonstrates an efficient way of sharing the music information within several vehicles in slow moving traffic.

Programming Languages: JAVA, XML,
Tools and IDEs: Android Studio 3.0.1, Samsung TAB 10.1, Android platform sdk

Future work will be to have a music subscription of different online music services which facilitate users to stream music online and let them download the songs to have them offline to play locally.
